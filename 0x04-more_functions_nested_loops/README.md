ALX Low Level Programming - More Functions, More Nested Loops

Welcome to the More Functions, More Nested Loops module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will learn about advanced functions and nested loops in the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview

The More Functions, More Nested Loops module is focused on teaching you more advanced functions and how to use nested loops in C programming. The topics covered in this module include:

Function Prototypes
Variable Scope
Recursion
Nested Loops
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started

Before starting this module, you should have a good understanding of C programming fundamentals such as data types, control flow, and functions. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials

All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops.

Folder Structure

The 0x04-more_functions_nested_loops folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-isupper.c: A program that checks if a character is uppercase.
1-isdigit.c: A program that checks if a character is a digit (0 through 9).
2-mul.c: A program that multiplies two integers.
3-print_numbers.c: A program that prints the numbers from 0 to 9.
4-print_most_numbers.c: A program that prints the numbers from 0 to 9, except for 2 and 4.
5-more_numbers.c: A program that prints the numbers from 0 to 14, ten times.
6-print_line.c: A program that draws a straight line in the terminal.
7-print_diagonal.c: A program that draws a diagonal line in the terminal.
8-print_square.c: A program that prints a square in the terminal.
9-fizz_buzz.c: A program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, but replaces multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both 3 and 5 with "FizzBuzz".
10-print_triangle.c: A program that prints a triangle in the terminal.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice working with advanced functions and nested loops in C programming.

Conclusion

Thank you for choosing ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course. We hope that this module on More Functions, More Nested Loops helps you to build a strong foundation in these advanced concepts of C programming. Good luck and happy coding!
