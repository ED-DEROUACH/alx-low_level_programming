0x10. C - Variadic functions
This repository contains exercises solved for the Variadic functions project, which is part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School.

Variadic functions are functions that accept a variable number of arguments. In C, we use the stdarg.h header to define such functions.

This project includes several tasks that require us to implement different variadic functions in C, such as the printf function, which is a commonly used function that accepts a variable number of arguments.

Requirements
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files were compiled on Ubuntu 20.04.3 LTS using gcc with the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic.
The code is written in C.
The code must follow the Betty style.
List of functions
The following functions were implemented as part of this project:

File	Prototype
0-sum_them_all.c	int sum_them_all(const unsigned int n, ...);
1-print_numbers.c	void print_numbers(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
2-print_strings.c	void print_strings(const char *separator, const unsigned int n, ...);
3-print_all.c	void print_all(const char * const format, ...);
Tasks
Task 0: Write a function that returns the sum of all its parameters.
Task 1: Write a function that prints numbers, followed by a new line.
Task 2: Write a function that prints strings, followed by a new line.
Task 3: Write a function that prints anything, followed by a new line.
Usage
To use these functions, you must include the corresponding header file and call the function with the appropriate arguments. For example, to use the sum_them_all function, you would include the "variadic_functions.h" header file and call the function with the number of arguments to be summed and the arguments themselves.

c
Copy code
#include "variadic_functions.h"
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    int sum;

    sum = sum_them_all(4, 1, 2, 3, 4);
    printf("Sum of 1, 2, 3, 4 is %d\n", sum);

    return (0);
}
Credits
These functions were implemented by Oussama ED-DEROUACH.
