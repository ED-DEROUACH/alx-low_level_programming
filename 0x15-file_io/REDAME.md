# 0x15. C - File I/O

This project is part of the low-level programming and algorithm track at Holberton School. In this project, we learn about file input/output operations in C programming language.

## Learning Objectives

The key learning objectives of this project are:

- How to create, open, close, read, and write files
- What are file descriptors and how to use them
- What are the different file modes and how to use them when opening a file
- What is a system call and how to use them
- How to use the functions `open`, `close`, `read`, and `write` in C

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using `gcc`, using the options `-Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89`
- All code should use the `Betty` style. 

## Project Tasks

The project consists of several tasks, each of which requires us to implement a C program that performs a specific file input/output operation. The tasks are as follows:

### 0. Tread lightly, she is near

A function that reads a text file and prints it to the POSIX standard output.

### 1. Under the snow

A function that creates a file.

### 2. Speak gently, she can hear

A function that appends text at the end of a file.

### 3. cp

A C program that copies the content of a file to another file.

### 4. elf

A C program that displays the information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.

## Conclusion

File I/O operations are an essential aspect of programming in C, and this project provides us with a solid foundation for understanding how to use them. By completing these tasks, we have gained valuable knowledge and experience that will be useful in future projects and in our careers as software developers.
