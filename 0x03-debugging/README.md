ALX Low Level Programming - Debugging
Welcome to the Debugging module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will learn about debugging techniques and tools for the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview
The Debugging module is focused on teaching you how to debug programs written in C programming language. You will learn how to use debugging tools such as GDB and Valgrind to find and fix bugs in your code. The topics covered in this module include:

Debugging Techniques
GDB
Valgrind
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started
Before starting this module, you should have a good understanding of C programming fundamentals such as data types, control flow, and functions. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials
All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x03-debugging.

Folder Structure
The 0x03-debugging folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-main.c: A program that contains a function with a bug.
1-main.c: A program that contains a function with a bug that causes a segmentation fault.
2-largest_number.c: A program that contains a function with a bug that causes it to return the wrong result.
3-print_remaining_days.c: A program that contains a function with a bug that causes it to return the wrong result.
holberton.h: A header file that contains function prototypes and macros.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice debugging techniques and tools in C programming.

Conclusion
Thank you for choosing ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course. We hope that this module on Debugging helps you to build a strong foundation in debugging techniques and tools for C programming. Good luck and happy coding!
