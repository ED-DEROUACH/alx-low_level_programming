ALX Low Level Programming - Functions and Nested Loops
Welcome to the Functions and Nested Loops module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will learn about functions, nested loops, and how to use them to solve problems in the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview
The Functions and Nested Loops module is focused on teaching you how to use functions and nested loops in C programming. You will learn how to define and call functions, use function arguments and return values, and write programs that use nested loops. The topics covered in this module include:

Functions
Function Arguments and Return Values
Nested Loops
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started
Before starting this module, you should have a good understanding of C programming fundamentals such as data types, control flow, and operators. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials
All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x02-functions_nested_loops.

Folder Structure
The 0x02-functions_nested_loops folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-holberton.c: A program that prints "Holberton" using a custom function.
1-alphabet.c: A program that prints the alphabet using a custom function.
2-print_alphabet_x10.c: A program that prints the alphabet 10 times using a nested loop and a custom function.
3-islower.c: A function that checks if a character is lowercase.
4-isalpha.c: A function that checks if a character is alphabetic.
5-sign.c: A function that prints the sign of a number.
6-abs.c: A function that computes the absolute value of an integer.
7-print_last_digit.c: A function that prints the last digit of a number.
8-24_hours.c: A program that prints every minute of a day using nested loops and custom functions.
9-times_table.c: A program that prints the times table up to 9 using nested loops and custom functions.
holberton.h: A header file that contains function prototypes and macros.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice using functions and nested loops in C programming.

Conclusion
Thank you for choosing ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course. We hope that this module on Functions and Nested Loops helps you to build a strong foundation in these important concepts for C programming. Good luck and happy coding!
