ALX Low Level Programming - Variables, if/else, while
Welcome to the Variables, if/else, while module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will learn about variables, if/else statements, and while loops, and how to use them to solve problems in the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview
The Variables, if/else, while module is focused on teaching you how to use variables, if/else statements, and while loops in C programming. You will learn how to declare and initialize variables, use if/else statements to make decisions in your programs, and use while loops to repeat code. The topics covered in this module include:

Variables
Data Types
Operators
Expressions
Statements
If/else Statements
Relational Operators
Logical Operators
Boolean Expressions
While Loops
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started
Before starting this module, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts such as data types, operators, expressions, and statements. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials
All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x01-variables_if_else_while.

Folder Structure
The 0x01-variables_if_else_while folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-positive_or_negative.c: A program that checks if a number is positive or negative.
1-last_digit.c: A program that prints the last digit of a number.
2-print_alphabet.c: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
3-print_alphabets.c: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, then uppercase.
4-print_alphabt.c: A program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, except for the letters 'q' and 'e'.
5-print_numbers.c: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
6-print_numberz.c: A program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, using only putchar.
7-print_tebahpla.c: A program that prints the alphabet in reverse.
8-print_base16.c: A program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
9-print_comb.c: A program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
10-print_comb2.c: A program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers.
100-print_comb3.c: A program that prints all possible combinations of two-digit numbers, without repeating any combination.
101-print_comb4.c: A program that prints all possible combinations of three-digit numbers, without repeating any combination.
holberton.h: A header file that contains function prototypes.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice using variables, if/else statements,
