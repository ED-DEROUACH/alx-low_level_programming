0x08. C - Recursion
This project is dedicated to understanding recursion in C.

File Descriptions
The files in this project are:

0-puts_recursion.c: a function that prints a string, followed by a new line, using recursion.
1-print_rev_recursion.c: a function that prints a string in reverse order, using recursion.
2-strlen_recursion.c: a function that calculates the length of a string, using recursion.
3-factorial.c: a function that calculates the factorial of a number, using recursion.
4-pow_recursion.c: a function that calculates the power of a number, using recursion.
5-sqrt_recursion.c: a function that calculates the square root of a number, using recursion.
6-is_prime_number.c: a function that determines whether a number is prime, using recursion.
7-is_palindrome.c: a function that determines whether a string is a palindrome, using recursion.
100-wildcmp.c: a function that compares two strings, allowing the use of wildcard characters * and ?.
Technologies
The projects are written in C and tested with the gcc compiler.
