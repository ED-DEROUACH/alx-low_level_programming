ALX Low Level Programming - More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Welcome to the More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will continue to learn about pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview

The More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings module is focused on deepening your understanding of pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. The topics covered in this module include:

More on Pointers
Multi-dimensional Arrays
Command Line Arguments
Memory Allocation
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started

Before starting this module, you should have a good understanding of C programming fundamentals such as data types, control flow, functions, and the topics covered in the previous Pointers, Arrays, and Strings module. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials

All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings.

Folder Structure

The 0x07-pointers_arrays_strings folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-memset.c: A program that fills memory with a constant byte.
1-memcpy.c: A program that copies memory area.
2-strchr.c: A program that locates a character in a string.
3-strspn.c: A program that gets the length of a prefix substring.
4-strpbrk.c: A program that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.
5-strstr.c: A program that locates a substring.
7-print_chessboard.c: A program that prints the chessboard.
8-print_diagsums.c: A program that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.
9-set_string.c: A program that sets the value of a pointer to a char.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice working with more advanced concepts related to pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

Conclusion

Thank you for choosing ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course. We hope that this module on More Pointers, Arrays, and Strings helps you to deepen your understanding and skills in C programming. Good luck and happy coding!
