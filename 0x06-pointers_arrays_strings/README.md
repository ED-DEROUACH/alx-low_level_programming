ALX Low Level Programming - Pointers, Arrays, and Strings

Welcome to the Pointers, Arrays, and Strings module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! In this module, you will learn about pointers, arrays, and strings in the C programming language. This README file is a guide to help you get started with this specific module.

Module Overview

The Pointers, Arrays, and Strings module is focused on teaching you how to work with pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming. The topics covered in this module include:

Pointers and how to use them
Arrays and how to work with them
Strings and how to manipulate them
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started

Before starting this module, you should have a good understanding of C programming fundamentals such as data types, control flow, and functions. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials

All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings.

Folder Structure

The 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-strcat.c: A program that concatenates two strings.
1-strncat.c: A program that concatenates two strings, but limits the number of characters copied from the source string.
2-strncpy.c: A program that copies a string, but limits the number of characters copied.
3-strcmp.c: A program that compares two strings.
4-rev_array.c: A program that reverses the content of an array of integers.
5-string_toupper.c: A program that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.
6-cap_string.c: A program that capitalizes all words of a string.
7-leet.c: A program that encodes a string into 1337 (leet) language.
100-rot13.c: A program that encodes a string using the rot13 encryption algorithm.
101-print_number.c: A program that prints an integer.
Each of the programs in this folder is designed to help you practice working with pointers, arrays, and strings in C programming.

Conclusion

Thank you for choosing ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course. We hope that this module on Pointers, Arrays, and Strings helps you to improve your understanding and skills in C programming. Good luck and happy coding!
