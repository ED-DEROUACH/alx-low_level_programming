ALX Low Level Programming - Hello, World!
Welcome to the Hello, World! module of ALX Africa's Low Level Programming course! This module is an introduction to the C programming language and focuses on teaching you how to write and compile your first C program.

Module Overview
The Hello, World! module is a short module that is focused on teaching you how to write and compile your first C program. The module covers the following topics:

C language basics
The printf function
Compiling C programs
Debugging C programs
This module is broken down into several lessons and exercises that will help you master each topic.

Getting Started
Before starting this module, you should have a basic understanding of programming concepts and terminology. You will also need a computer with a C compiler installed. We recommend using either GCC or Clang, both of which are free and open-source.

You can download GCC from the official website: https://gcc.gnu.org/

You can download Clang from the official website: https://clang.llvm.org/

Module Materials
All of the materials for this module, including lessons, exercises, and projects, will be provided through the ALX Africa platform. You will need to create an account on the platform to access the materials. You will also be able to communicate with your peers and instructors through the platform.

The module materials are organized into several folders, each containing a set of files related to a specific topic. The main folder for this module is 0x00-hello_world.

Folder Structure
The 0x00-hello_world folder contains several subfolders and files. Here is a breakdown of the folder structure:

0-preprocessor: A folder containing exercises related to the C preprocessor.
1-compiler: A folder containing exercises related to compiling C programs.
2-assembler: A folder containing exercises related to the C compiler and assembler.
3-name: A folder containing an exercise that requires you to write a C program that prints your name.
4-puts.c: A C program that prints a string using the puts function.
5-printf.c: A C program that prints a string using the printf function.
6-size.c: A C program that prints the size of various data types.
README.md: A README file containing information about the module.
Each of the exercises in this folder is designed to help you learn how to write and compile C programs, and to practice using the printf function. Once you have completed all of the exercises in this module, you will have a solid foundation in C programming and will be ready to move on to more advanced topics.
